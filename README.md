# MinecraftSolidColorMaker
A small utility for converting Minecraft textures to solid colors

While working on my mods I often need to create solid color textures from vanilla textures (wool, glass, etc). This program automates that task by sampling the top left pixel of the texture and uses it to create a new one.

### Usage

`MinecraftSolidColorMaker.exe path-to-textures path-to-save-folder`

### Dependencies
SixLabors.ImageSharp
