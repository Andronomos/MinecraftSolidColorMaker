A small utility for converting Minecraft textures to solid colors


While working on my mods, I often need to take the colors of certain textures (wool, glass, etc.) and convert them to solid colors for use in custom blocks. Doing this manually is tedious.

This program will sample the color of the texture using the top left pixel and create a new one using that color as the fill.
